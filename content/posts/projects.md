List of my public projects/repos in no particular order:

- [ComfyUI Static Primitives](https://github.com/80sVectorz/ComfyUI-Static-Primitives)  
This project aims to add "Static primitives" to ComfyUI allowing you to reroute data primitives.  
I try to update it when people open issues, but I'm not very active with updating it.

- [Chimer](https://github.com/80sVectorz/chimer)  
Chimer is a CLI timer application I made. The main reason I made it was to practice Rust.

- [Soft Nudge](https://github.com/80sVectorz/soft_nudge)  
Soft Nudge is a python module with the goal of providing a reminder without the invasive beeps of conventional timers.

- [Cap mEss](https://github.com/80sVectorz/capMess)  
Cap mEss is a joke tool that I made just for shits and giggles. It makes the caps-lock function randomly toggle, resulting in text like this:
HeLo mY NaME iS ChIp

- [Portal](https://github.com/80sVectorz/portal)  
Portal is a tool that I made to solve the problem of having to type a lot when hopping directories. 
I don't use it anymore since I switched to FISH as my go-to shell.
And recently I also switched to a WSL based installation.

- [Speedcom transmissions/universe](https://tinyurl.com/daily-speedcom)  
This project was a mix of world building and story telling.
It was also a good practice in persistence for me.  
The log documents consists of a daily "speedcom" transmission.  
The goal was for it to be like listening to an alternate universe radio station.
With in depth and coherent world building. I have a large Wiki file with a bunch of hidden info.
Sadly I only managed to stick to it for 6 transmissions.
However I do still want to continue fleshing out this fictional universe.

- [G.I.F.T](https://github.com/80sVectorz/gift)  
GIFT, or generalized interactive fiction tool, is a toolkit/library that tries to offer a generalized foundation for creating text-based interactive experiences.
It's a pet project of mine and will probably never reach a finished state.
So I don't recommend actually using it.
I just put up the code for anyone who may be inspired by it.
